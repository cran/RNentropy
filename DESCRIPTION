Description: An implementation of a method based on information theory devised 
    for the identification of genes showing a significant variation of expression
    across multiple conditions. Given expression estimates from any number of 
    RNA-Seq samples and conditions it identifies genes or transcripts with a 
    significant variation of expression across all the conditions studied, 
    together with the samples in which they are over- or under-expressed.
